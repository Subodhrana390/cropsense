## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account or a local MongoDB instance.
-   A [Google AI API Key](https://ai.google.dev/).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following variables:

    ```env
    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

    # Your Google AI API Key for Genkit
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

    # A secret key for signing JWTs (any long, random string will do)
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY"
    ```

### Running the Application

This application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit development server for the AI flows.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the web application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit development server:**
    Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the Genkit toolchain, which makes the AI flows available to the Next.js application.

Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your browser at the specified localhost address.
